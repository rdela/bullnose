bullnose includes and extends exceptional libraries for building websites.

bullnose began as a boilerplate for static websites and is evolving into various skeleton templates, the first of which to launch, probably the WordPress version, will reside here. Subsequent adaptations for various static generators and publishing engines will have separate repos to avoid bloat. 

[Bullnose][] is a term used in building construction for rounded convex trim, particularly in masonry and ceramic tile.

This empty repo is a placeholder for the project that may eventually exist here.
