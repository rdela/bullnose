bullnose includes and extends exceptional libraries for building websites.

bullnose began years ago as a boilerplate for static websites, evolving over the years into various skeleton templates and themes. None of the adaptations for various publishing engines and static generators have made sense to open source yet, but some interesting new developments may lead to a non-empty repo here one day. This empty repo is a placeholder for the project that may eventually exist here. Subsequent adaptations for various static generators and publishing engines will have separate repos to avoid bloat.

[Bullnose][] is a term used in building construction for rounded convex trim, particularly in masonry and ceramic tile.
